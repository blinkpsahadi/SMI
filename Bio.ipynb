shell-lipid core nanoparticles for enhanced pulmonary siRNA delivery in 2D and 3D lung cancer cell models.\n","\n","Abstract: Faced with the threat of lung cancer-related deaths worldwide, small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence tumor related messenger RNA (mRNA) to tackle the issue of drug resistance with enhanced anti-tumor effects. However, how to increase lung tumor targeting and penetration with enhanced gene silencing are the issues to be addressed. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of designing non-viral siRNA vectors for enhanced lung tumor therapy via inhalation. Here, shell-core based polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) were prepared via microfluidics by coating PLGA on siRNA-loaded cationic liposomes (Lipoplexes). Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy study demonstrated that HNP consists of a PLGA shell and a lipid core. Atomic force microscopy study indicated that the rigidity of HNPs could be well tuned by changing thickness of the PLGA shell. The designed HNPs were muco-inert with increased stability in mucus and BALF, good safety, enhanced mucus penetration and cellular uptake. Crucially, HNP1 with the thinnest PLGA shell exhibited superior transfection efficiency (84.83%) in A549 cells, which was comparable to that of lipoplexes and Lipofectamine 2000, and its tumor permeability was 1.88 times that of lipoplexes in A549-3T3 tumor spheroids. After internalization of the HNPs, not only endosomal escape but also lysosomal exocytosis was observed. The transfection efficiency of HNP1 (39.33%) was 2.26 times that of lipoplexes in A549-3T3 tumor spheroids. Moreover, HNPs exhibited excellent stability during nebulization via soft mist inhaler. In conclusion, our study reveals the great potential of HNP1 in siRNA delivery for lung cancer therapy via inhalation.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 37201764, Title: Optimization of formulation and atomization of lipid nanoparticles for the inhalation of mRNA.\n","\n","Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have demonstrated efficacy and safety for mRNA vaccine administration by intramuscular injection; however, the pulmonary delivery of mRNA encapsulated LNPs remains challenging. The atomization process of LNPs will cause shear stress due to dispersed air, air jets, ultrasonication, vibrating mesh etc., leading to the agglomeration or leakage of LNPs, which can be detrimental to transcellular transport and endosomal escape. In this study, the LNP formulation, atomization methods and buffer system were optimized to maintain the LNP stability and mRNA efficiency during the atomization process. Firstly, a suitable LNP formulation for atomization was optimized based on the in vitro results, and the optimized LNP formulation was AX4, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG<sub>2K</sub> at a 35/16/46.5/2.5 (%) molar ratio. Subsequently, different atomization methods were compared to find the most suitable method to deliver mRNA-LNP solution. Soft mist inhaler (SMI) was found to be the best for pulmonary delivery of mRNA encapsulated LNPs. The physico-chemical properties such as size and entrapment efficiency (EE) of the LNPs were further improved by adjusting the buffer system with trehalose. Lastly, the in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice demonstrated that SMI with proper LNPs design and buffer system hold promise for inhaled mRNA-LNP therapies.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 27848886, Title: Liposomes for Pulmonary Drug Delivery: The Role of Formulation and Inhalation Device Design.\n","\n","Abstract: Liposomes are established drug carriers for inhalation owing to their safety and ability to provide controlled drug release in the lung. These carriers can entrap a wide range of therapeutic molecules for delivery in large volumes to the peripheral airways using medical nebulizers. Pressurized metered inhalers (pMDIs), soft mist inhalers (SMIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) can deliver relatively small quantities of medication to the lung when compared to medical nebulizers which can deliver large volumes using simple liposome preparation techniques. Unfortunately, the shearing provided during nebulization to convert the aqueous liposome dispersions into \"respirable\" aerosol droplets may exert physical stress on liposome bilayers, causing losses of the originally entrapped drug. The development of successful liposome carriers for inhalation depends on two main factors which are formulation composition and nebulizer design, with the aim of reducing the detrimental effect of shearing on liposome stability and maximizing the deposition of vesicles in the 'deep lung'. A number of nebulizable liposome formulations have reached clinical trials. For example, Arikace® (liposomal amikacin) and Pulmaquin® (liposomal ciprofloxacin) are antibacterial formulations currently in advanced stages of development. In this review, the role of liposome formulation and inhalation device design on the suitability of liposomes for eliciting controlled drug release in the lung was evaluated. Moreover, the factors contributing to the success of Arikace® in clinical trials were appraised.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 10.1201/9780429055201-21, Title: Soft Mist Inhalers\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1016/j.resinv.2017.03.003, Title: Comparison of the aerosol velocity of two Respimat ® soft mist inhalers and two pressurized metered-dose inhalers for short-acting muscarinic antagonists\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1016/j.jval.2022.09.1346, Title: HSD2 Reusable Soft Mist Inhalers Have an Improved Carbon Footprint Compared With Dry Powder Inhalers and Pressurised Metered-Dose Inhalers\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1111/imj.16530, Title: Environmental impact of pressurised metered dose inhalers versus dry powder and soft mist inhalers at a <scp>tertiary Melbourne hospital</scp>\n","\n","Abstract: <jats:p>The carbon footprint of devices to deliver inhaled respiratory medications has come into focus as climate change has been identified as a worldwide emergency.

Tunable rigidity of PLGA shell-lipid core nanoparticles for enhanced pulmonary siRNA delivery in 2D and 3D lung cancer cell models.\n","\n","Abstract: Faced with the threat of lung cancer-related deaths worldwide, small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence tumor related messenger RNA (mRNA) to tackle the issue of drug resistance with enhanced anti-tumor effects. However, how to increase lung tumor targeting and penetration with enhanced gene silencing are the issues to be addressed. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of designing non-viral siRNA vectors for enhanced lung tumor therapy via inhalation. Here, shell-core based polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) were prepared via microfluidics by coating PLGA on siRNA-loaded cationic liposomes (Lipoplexes). Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy study demonstrated that HNP consists of a PLGA shell and a lipid core. Atomic force microscopy study indicated that the rigidity of HNPs could be well tuned by changing thickness of the PLGA shell. The designed HNPs were muco-inert with increased stability in mucus and BALF, good safety, enhanced mucus penetration and cellular uptake. Crucially, HNP1 with the thinnest PLGA shell exhibited superior transfection efficiency (84.83%) in A549 cells, which was comparable to that of lipoplexes and Lipofectamine 2000, and its tumor permeability was 1.88 times that of lipoplexes in A549-3T3 tumor spheroids. After internalization of the HNPs, not only endosomal escape but also lysosomal exocytosis was observed. The transfection efficiency of HNP1 (39.33%) was 2.26 times that of lipoplexes in A549-3T3 tumor spheroids. Moreover, HNPs exhibited excellent stability during nebulization via soft mist inhaler. In conclusion, our study reveals the great potential of HNP1 in siRNA delivery for lung cancer therapy via inhalation.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 37201764, Title: Optimization of formulation and atomization of lipid nanoparticles for the inhalation of mRNA.\n","\n","Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have demonstrated efficacy and safety for mRNA vaccine administration by intramuscular injection; however, the pulmonary delivery of mRNA encapsulated LNPs remains challenging. The atomization process of LNPs will cause shear stress due to dispersed air, air jets, ultrasonication, vibrating mesh etc., leading to the agglomeration or leakage of LNPs, which can be detrimental to transcellular transport and endosomal escape. In this study, the LNP formulation, atomization methods and buffer system were optimized to maintain the LNP stability and mRNA efficiency during the atomization process. Firstly, a suitable LNP formulation for atomization was optimized based on the in vitro results, and the optimized LNP formulation was AX4, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG<sub>2K</sub> at a 35/16/46.5/2.5 (%) molar ratio. Subsequently, different atomization methods were compared to find the most suitable method to deliver mRNA-LNP solution. Soft mist inhaler (SMI) was found to be the best for pulmonary delivery of mRNA encapsulated LNPs. The physico-chemical properties such as size and entrapment efficiency (EE) of the LNPs were further improved by adjusting the buffer system with trehalose. Lastly, the in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice demonstrated that SMI with proper LNPs design and buffer system hold promise for inhaled mRNA-LNP therapies.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 27848886, Title: Liposomes for Pulmonary Drug Delivery: The Role of Formulation and Inhalation Device Design.\n","\n","Abstract: Liposomes are established drug carriers for inhalation owing to their safety and ability to provide controlled drug release in the lung. These carriers can entrap a wide range of therapeutic molecules for delivery in large volumes to the peripheral airways using medical nebulizers. Pressurized metered inhalers (pMDIs), soft mist inhalers (SMIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) can deliver relatively small quantities of medication to the lung when compared to medical nebulizers which can deliver large volumes using simple liposome preparation techniques. Unfortunately, the shearing provided during nebulization to convert the aqueous liposome dispersions into \"respirable\" aerosol droplets may exert physical stress on liposome bilayers, causing losses of the originally entrapped drug. The development of successful liposome carriers for inhalation depends on two main factors which are formulation composition and nebulizer design, with the aim of reducing the detrimental effect of shearing on liposome stability and maximizing the deposition of vesicles in the 'deep lung'. A number of nebulizable liposome formulations have reached clinical trials. For example, Arikace® (liposomal amikacin) and Pulmaquin® (liposomal ciprofloxacin) are antibacterial formulations currently in advanced stages of development. In this review, the role of liposome formulation and inhalation device design on the suitability of liposomes for eliciting controlled drug release in the lung was evaluated. Moreover, the factors contributing to the success of Arikace® in clinical trials were appraised.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 10.1201/9780429055201-21, Title: Soft Mist Inhalers\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1016/j.resinv.2017.03.003, Title: Comparison of the aerosol velocity of two Respimat ® soft mist inhalers and two pressurized metered-dose inhalers for short-acting muscarinic antagonists\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1016/j.jval.2022.09.1346, Title: HSD2 Reusable Soft Mist Inhalers Have an Improved Carbon Footprint Compared With Dry Powder Inhalers and Pressurised Metered-Dose Inhalers\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1111/imj.16530, Title: Environmental impact of pressurised metered dose inhalers versus dry powder and soft mist inhalers at a <scp>tertiary Melbourne hospital</scp>\n","\n","Abstract: <jats:p>The carbon footprint of devices to deliver inhaled respiratory medications has come into focus as climate change has been identified as a worldwide emergency.

3D lung cancer cell models.\n","\n","Abstract: Faced with the threat of lung cancer-related deaths worldwide, small interfering RNA (siRNA) can silence tumor related messenger RNA (mRNA) to tackle the issue of drug resistance with enhanced anti-tumor effects. However, how to increase lung tumor targeting and penetration with enhanced gene silencing are the issues to be addressed. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the feasibility of designing non-viral siRNA vectors for enhanced lung tumor therapy via inhalation. Here, shell-core based polymer-lipid hybrid nanoparticles (HNPs) were prepared via microfluidics by coating PLGA on siRNA-loaded cationic liposomes (Lipoplexes). Transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy study demonstrated that HNP consists of a PLGA shell and a lipid core. Atomic force microscopy study indicated that the rigidity of HNPs could be well tuned by changing thickness of the PLGA shell. The designed HNPs were muco-inert with increased stability in mucus and BALF, good safety, enhanced mucus penetration and cellular uptake. Crucially, HNP1 with the thinnest PLGA shell exhibited superior transfection efficiency (84.83%) in A549 cells, which was comparable to that of lipoplexes and Lipofectamine 2000, and its tumor permeability was 1.88 times that of lipoplexes in A549-3T3 tumor spheroids. After internalization of the HNPs, not only endosomal escape but also lysosomal exocytosis was observed. The transfection efficiency of HNP1 (39.33%) was 2.26 times that of lipoplexes in A549-3T3 tumor spheroids. Moreover, HNPs exhibited excellent stability during nebulization via soft mist inhaler. In conclusion, our study reveals the great potential of HNP1 in siRNA delivery for lung cancer therapy via inhalation.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_38237688_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 37201764, Title: Optimization of formulation and atomization of lipid nanoparticles for the inhalation of mRNA.\n","\n","Abstract: Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) have demonstrated efficacy and safety for mRNA vaccine administration by intramuscular injection; however, the pulmonary delivery of mRNA encapsulated LNPs remains challenging. The atomization process of LNPs will cause shear stress due to dispersed air, air jets, ultrasonication, vibrating mesh etc., leading to the agglomeration or leakage of LNPs, which can be detrimental to transcellular transport and endosomal escape. In this study, the LNP formulation, atomization methods and buffer system were optimized to maintain the LNP stability and mRNA efficiency during the atomization process. Firstly, a suitable LNP formulation for atomization was optimized based on the in vitro results, and the optimized LNP formulation was AX4, DSPC, cholesterol and DMG-PEG<sub>2K</sub> at a 35/16/46.5/2.5 (%) molar ratio. Subsequently, different atomization methods were compared to find the most suitable method to deliver mRNA-LNP solution. Soft mist inhaler (SMI) was found to be the best for pulmonary delivery of mRNA encapsulated LNPs. The physico-chemical properties such as size and entrapment efficiency (EE) of the LNPs were further improved by adjusting the buffer system with trehalose. Lastly, the in vivo fluorescence imaging of mice demonstrated that SMI with proper LNPs design and buffer system hold promise for inhaled mRNA-LNP therapies.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_37201764_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 27848886, Title: Liposomes for Pulmonary Drug Delivery: The Role of Formulation and Inhalation Device Design.\n","\n","Abstract: Liposomes are established drug carriers for inhalation owing to their safety and ability to provide controlled drug release in the lung. These carriers can entrap a wide range of therapeutic molecules for delivery in large volumes to the peripheral airways using medical nebulizers. Pressurized metered inhalers (pMDIs), soft mist inhalers (SMIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs) can deliver relatively small quantities of medication to the lung when compared to medical nebulizers which can deliver large volumes using simple liposome preparation techniques. Unfortunately, the shearing provided during nebulization to convert the aqueous liposome dispersions into \"respirable\" aerosol droplets may exert physical stress on liposome bilayers, causing losses of the originally entrapped drug. The development of successful liposome carriers for inhalation depends on two main factors which are formulation composition and nebulizer design, with the aim of reducing the detrimental effect of shearing on liposome stability and maximizing the deposition of vesicles in the 'deep lung'. A number of nebulizable liposome formulations have reached clinical trials. For example, Arikace® (liposomal amikacin) and Pulmaquin® (liposomal ciprofloxacin) are antibacterial formulations currently in advanced stages of development. In this review, the role of liposome formulation and inhalation device design on the suitability of liposomes for eliciting controlled drug release in the lung was evaluated. Moreover, the factors contributing to the success of Arikace® in clinical trials were appraised.\n","\n","Source: PubMed\n","Similar Articles:\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_0, Title: Titre d'article similaire 1, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 1.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_1, Title: Titre d'article similaire 2, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 2.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_2, Title: Titre d'article similaire 3, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 3.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_3, Title: Titre d'article similaire 4, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 4.\n","  - Similar ID: similar_27848886_4, Title: Titre d'article similaire 5, Abstract: Résumé de l'article similaire 5.\n","\n","ID: 10.1201/9780429055201-21, Title: Soft Mist Inhalers\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1016/j.resinv.2017.03.003, Title: Comparison of the aerosol velocity of two Respimat ® soft mist inhalers and two pressurized metered-dose inhalers for short-acting muscarinic antagonists\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1016/j.jval.2022.09.1346, Title: HSD2 Reusable Soft Mist Inhalers Have an Improved Carbon Footprint Compared With Dry Powder Inhalers and Pressurised Metered-Dose Inhalers\n","\n","Abstract: Aucune description disponible\n","\n","Source: CrossRef\n","Similar Articles:\n","\n","ID: 10.1111/imj.16530, Title: Environmental impact of pressurised metered dose inhalers versus dry powder and soft mist inhalers at a <scp>tertiary Melbourne hospital</scp>\n","\n","Abstract: <jats:p>The carbon footprint of devices to deliver inhaled respiratory medications has come into focus as climate change has been identified as a worldwide emergency.
