Different inhalers have distinct characteristics affecting drug administration and patient adherence, which can impact clinical outcomes. We report on the development of the Respimat((R)) soft mist inhaler (SMI) and compare key attributes with metered-dose inhalers (MDIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). The Respimat SMI, a pocket-sized device generating a single-breath, inhalable aerosol, was designed to enhance drug delivery to the lungs, reduce the requirements for patient coordination and inspiratory effort, and improve the patients' experience and ease of use. The drug deposition profile with Respimat SMI is favorable compared with MDIs and DPIs, with higher drug deposition to the lung and peripheral airways. The slow velocity and long spray duration of the Respimat SMI aerosol also aid patient coordination. Clinical equivalence has been demonstrated for maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease using once-daily tiotropium between Respimat SMI (5 microg) and HandiHaler DPI (18 microg). In comparative studies, patients preferred Respimat SMI to MDIs and DPIs; they reported that Respimat SMI was easy to use and felt the inhaled dose was delivered. The Respimat SMI, designed to generate a slow-moving and fine mist, is easy to use and effectively delivers drug treatment to the lungs. The patient-centered design of Respimat SMI improved patient satisfaction, and may help to promote long-term adherence and improve clinical outcomes with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n","**Title:** The Respimat Soft Mist Inhaler, a Novel Inhaled Drug Delivery Device.\n","**Abstract:**\n","Summary The Respimat SMI offers a novel delivery mechanism for the management of primarily COPD, but asthma as well. Presently, four different medications, as monotherapy or a combination of two active ingredients, are available using the Respimat SMI technology. Multiple studies have demonstrated safety and efficacy of these drugs when delivered via Respimat SMI. Patients tend to prefer the Respimat SMI over traditional inhaler devices, as it overcomes some of the disadvantages posed by traditional delivery devices.\n","**Title:** Aerosol Delivery Devices for Obstructive Lung Diseases.\n","**Abstract:**\n","Drug delivery by inhalation is the principal strategy to treat obstructive lung diseases, which affect about 15% of the population in the United States. Aerosol delivery devices have evolved over more than 60 years from the basic pressurized metered-dose inhaler and nebulizer to numerous types of inhalers and devices, including valved holder chambers, dry powder inhalers, soft mist inhalers, as well as smart inhalers and nebulizers. Although these devices improve a patient's ability to self-administer medication, many problems with optimal delivery still exist. Appropriate selection and repeated patient education can help lessen the problems with these devices. Aerosol science is evolving, with methods of measurement that include radio-scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging, to provide a better understanding of aerosol delivery and effects. Understanding the science and clinical application of aerosol drug delivery can substantially aid clinicians in optimizing these therapies for their patients.\n","**Title:** Nebulized Therapies in COPD: Past, Present, and the Future.\n","**Abstract:**\n","Current guidelines recommend inhalation therapy as the preferred route of drug administration for treating patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Inhalation devices consist of nebulizers and handheld inhalers, such as dry-powder inhalers (DPIs), pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), and soft mist inhalers (SMIs). Although pMDIs, DPIs and SMIs may be appropriate for most patients with COPD, certain patient populations may have challenges with these devices. Patients who have cognitive, neuromuscular, or ventilatory impairments (and receive limited assistance from caregivers), as well as those with suboptimal peak inspiratory flow may not derive the full benefit from handheld inhalers. A considerable number of patients are not capable of producing a peak inspiratory flow rate to overcome the internal resistance of DPIs. Furthermore, patients may have difficulty coordinating inhalation with device actuation, which is required for pMDIs and SMIs. However, inhalation devices such as spacers and valved holding chambers can be used with pMDIs to increase the efficiency of aerosol delivery. Nebulized treatment provides patients with COPD an alternative administration route that avoids the need for inspiratory flow, manual dexterity, or complex hand-breath coordination. The recent approval of two nebulized long-acting muscarinic antagonists has added to the extensive range of nebulized therapies in COPD. Furthermore, with the availability of quieter and more portable nebulizer devices, nebulization may be a useful treatment option in the management of certain patient populations with COPD. The aim of this narrative review was to highlight recent updates and the treatment landscape in nebulized therapy and COPD. We first discuss the pathophysiology of patients with COPD and inhalation device considerations. Second, we review the updates on recently approved and newly marketed nebulized treatments, nebulized treatments currently in development, and technological advances in nebulizer devices. Finally, we discuss the current applications of nebulized therapy in patients with COPD.\n","**Title:** Tiotropium Respimat((R)) Soft Mist inhaler: a review of its use in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\n","**Abstract:**\n","The long-acting anticholinergic agent tiotropium bromide (Spiriva((R))) is available as a solution for inhalation via Respimat((R)) Soft Mist Inhaler in the EU and various other countries for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). With the Respimat((R)) Soft Mist Inhaler there is improved lung deposition of drug (allowing a reduced dosage compared with tiotropium HandiHaler((R))), the delivered drug dose is independent of inspiratory effort and the prolonged duration of the aerosol cloud should make the co-ordination of actuation and inhalation easier. In patients with COPD, tiotropium Respimat((R)) improved lung function, COPD exacerbations, health-related quality of life and dyspnoea and was at least as effective as tiotropium HandiHaler((R)). Tiotropium Respimat((R)) was generally well tolerated in patients with COPD, with anticholinergic adverse events among the most commonly reported adverse events. In the TIOSPIR trial, tiotropium Respimat((R)) was noninferior to tiotropium HandiHaler((R)) in terms of all-cause mortality, and the risk of cardiovascular mortality or major adverse cardiovascular events did not significantly differ between the two treatment groups. In conclusion, tiotropium Respimat((R)) Soft Mist Inhaler is a useful option for the treatment of patients with COPD.\n"]}],"source":["!pip install openai sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary > /dev/null 2>&1\n","!pip install openai --upgrade > /dev/null 2>&1\n","!pip install biopython > /dev/null 2>&1\n","\n","# Importation des bibliothèques nécessaires\n","from Bio import Entrez, Medline\n","from transformers import pipeline\n","import concurrent.futures\n","import openai\n","\n","# Configuration de l'email pour Entrez\n","Entrez.email = \"worthylastchance@gmail.com\"\n","\n","openai.api_key = \"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\"\n","pubmed_query = \"soft mist inhaler\"  # Example query\n","retmax = 5  # Number of records to retrieve (max 100,000 per query)\n","\n","# Retrieve PubMed IDs\n","handle = Entrez.esearch(db='pubmed',\n","                        sort='relevance',\n","                        retmax=retmax,\n","                        retmode='text',\n","                        term=pubmed_query)\n","record = Entrez.read(handle)\n","handle.close()\n","idlist = record[\"IdList\"]\n","\n","# Fetch & Print Article Details and Summarize\n","for id in idlist:\n","    handle = Entrez.efetch(db='pubmed', rettype='medline', retmode='text', id=id)\n","    record = Medline.read(handle)\n","    handle.close()\n","\n","    # Extract relevant info\n","    title = record.get(\"TI\", \"\")\n","    abstract = record.get(\"AB\", \"\")\n","    print(f\"**Title:** {title}\\n**Abstract:**\\n{abstract}\")\n","\n","    def summarize_abstract(abstract):\n","        try:\n","            prompt = f\"Résumer le résumé suivant en 50 mots:\\n{abstract}\"\n","            openai_params = {\n","                \"engine\": \"gpt-4\",  # Utilisation de GPT-4\n","                \"prompt\": prompt,\n","                \"temperature\": 0.5,  # Une valeur plus basse pour plus de cohérence\n","                \"max_tokens\": 100,  # Ajustez selon vos besoins de longueur de réponse\n","                \"top_p\": 1,\n","                \"frequency_penalty\": 0.2  # Peut aider à réduire les répétitions\n","            }\n","            response = openai.Completion.create(**openai_params)\n","\n","            # Récupération et affichage du résumé généré\n","            if response.choices:\n","                generated_summary = response.choices[0].text.strip()\n","                print(f\"**Résumé Généré (GPT-4):**\\n{generated_summary}\\n---\\n\")\n","            else:\n","                print(\"**Erreur:** Aucun résumé généré reçu de l'API OpenAI.\\n---\\n\")\n","\n","        except openai.OpenAIError as e:\n","            print(f\"**Erreur OpenAI:** {e}\\n---\\n\")\n","        except Exception as e:\n","            print(f\"**Erreur Inattendue:** {e}\\n---\\n\")\n","\n","    # Appelez la fonction pour chaque abstract\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install openai sqlalchemy psycopg2-binary > /dev/null 2>&1\n","!pip install openai --upgrade > /dev/null 2>&1\n","!pip install biopython > /dev/null 2>&1\n","from openai import OpenAI\n","\n","client = OpenAI(\n","  base_url = \"https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1\",\n","  api_key = \"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\"\n",")\n","\n","completion = client.chat.completions.create(\n","  model=\"meta/llama3-70b-instruct\",\n","  messages=[{\"role\":\"user\",\"content\":\" look for 5 of the most recent online articles about soft mist inhalers and give me their summary, their publication date, their DOI, as well as their sources and a direct link to access these articles\"}],\n","  temperature=0.5,\n","  top_p=1,\n","  max_tokens=1024,\n","  stream=True\n",")\n","\n","for chunk in completion:\n","  if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:\n","    print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content, end=\"\")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UFq4mXewLdoC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1734432233530,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":21897,"user":{"displayName":"lastchance worthy","userId":"15170202029003060516"}},"outputId":"7a123819-71a9-4c6f-8796-25acdce7b55e"},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["After conducting a search, I found 5 recent online articles about soft mist inhalers.
