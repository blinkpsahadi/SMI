The Estrogen Receptor (ER) had been one of the first biomarkers used in breast cancer and has helped advance the field of breast oncology by contributing to the success of hormonal therapies for the ER positive subgroup of the disease. Expression of the receptor in 1% or more of tumor cells in immunohistochemical sections define currently the ER positive subgroup of breast cancers, which may be treated with regimens that include hormonal inhibitors. The highest sensitivity and benefit of hormonal therapies is observed in cancers with robust ER expression (in 90% to 100% of tumor cells). However, it has become clear that the subgroup of breast cancers with low ER expression (in 1% to 10% of tumor cells) behaves similarly to ER negative breast cancers and has an inferior response to hormonal therapies. The behavior of the rest of ER positive breast cancers with an intermediate ER expression between these 2 extremes (ER expression between 10% and 90%) is less well described and their response to estrogen targeting therapies is less clear. Breast cancers with intermediate ER expression represent a small subgroup of ER positive breast cancers and the wide range of expressions suggests heterogeneity. This review will discuss this subgroup of ER positive breast cancers and examine their genomic landscape and therapeutic repercussions.\n","Journal : Clinical breast cancer\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : S1526-8209(24)00334-3\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 39710442\n","Titre : HER2DX genomic test in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer.\n","Résumé : Therapies targeting human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive breast cancer significantly impact patient outcomes, quality of life, and health care systems. While chemotherapy and trastuzumab improve survival in early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, variability in clinical and biological characteristics leads to different response to therapies and outcomes. Clinical guidelines provide general recommendations, but significant uncertainty persists in identifying an optimal treatment plan for individual patients. The HER2DX genomic test informs treatment decisions for stage 1-3 HER2-positive breast cancer by integrating biological factors and clinical factors (tumor size and nodal status). It provides three scores relevant to patient management: long-term prognosis (risk score), likelihood of achieving pathological complete response (pCR score), and ERBB2 mRNA expression (ERBB2 score). This article offers an expert overview of HER2DX, covering score interpretation, clinical applications, ongoing studies, and future directions. By analyzing the genomic profiles of HER2-positive tumors, HER2DX provides independent information regarding therapeutic responses and disease prognosis, thereby enabling physicians to navigate the increasing complexity of managing patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Key findings show that HER2DX predicts relapse-free survival and probability of pCR to a variety of neoadjuvant therapy regimens, which aids in personalizing treatment plans that could reduce over-treatment and under-treatment. The article underscores expert recommendations to help integrate HER2DX into clinical practice, aiming to enhance decision making and clinical outcomes.\n","Journal : ESMO open\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : 10.1016/j.esmoop.2024.103987\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 39709874\n","Titre : The effect of prolonged cold ischemia time on breast cancer biomarker expression after neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n","Résumé : Prolonged cold ischemia time (CIT) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) can each independently impact the expression of breast cancer-related biomarkers, but their combined effects are not well studied. Herein, we assessed whether prolonged CIT has a higher modulatory effect on post-NACT biomarker expression in breast cancer specimens than in otherwise similar but non-NACT specimens. Our study cohort included 334 biopsy/resection breast cancer specimen pairs in which immunohistochemistry (IHC for estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], HER2) and HER2 FISH had been performed on both specimens. These included 209 pairs with a post-NACT resection (NACT[+]), and 125 pairs unassociated with NACT (NACT[-]). Each group was subclassified into prolonged CIT (>1 hr; CITp) and non-prolonged CIT (≤1 hr, CITnp). NACT[+]/CITp (n = 125) and NACT[-]/CITp (n = 84) subgroups showed no statistically significant differences regarding the frequency of biopsy-to-resection change in the final result [i.e. positive versus negative] for any of the 4 biomarkers. Similarly, the NACT[+]/CITp and NACT[+]/CITnp subgroups showed no significant differences regarding the percentage of cases with any biopsy-to-resection change in final result for ER, HER2 (IHC) and HER2 (FISH). For PR, a biopsy-to-resection change in status was more commonly observed in CITnp (44.1 %) as compared to the CITp (19.2 %) subgroup (p = 0.02). In summary, we found no conclusive evidence that prolonged CIT has a more significant modulatory effect on biomarker expression in post-NACT breast cancer resection specimens than their otherwise comparable (i.e. NACT[-], CITp) counterparts regarding the final test result, which suggests that post-NACT specimens do not require more stringent CIT-related handling requirements than NACT[-] specimens.\n","Journal : Pathology, research and practice\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : 10.1016/j.prp.2024.155781\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 39709832\n","Titre : Dual-mode exosome detection leveraging a nanozyme-active artificial receptor: PDA@Fe@Zn-based nucleic acid aptamer sensor.\n","Résumé : Exosomes, extracellular vesicles crucial for intercellular communication, are emerging as significant biomarkers for disease diagnosis, especially in cancer. This study presented a dual-mode exosome detection platform using polydopamine microspheres doped with iron and zinc ions (PDA@Fe@Zn). These materials served as both artificial receptors for nucleic acid aptamers and nanozymes with peroxidase-like activity. By integrating colorimetric and fluorescence detection, the platform enables cross-validation of results. PDA@Fe@Zn nanozymes catalyzed the TMB-H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> reaction under acidic conditions, producing a colorimetric signal proportional to exosome concentration. Concurrently, the fluorescence of FAM-labeled aptamers was dynamically quenched by PDA@Fe@Zn and the presence of exosomes restores the fluorescence signal for a \"turn-on\" detection mode. DNase I amplified detection signals by cleaving bound exosomes for multiple cycles, achieving a limit of detection (LOD) of 4.7 × 10<sup>4</sup> particles/mL for colorimetric detection and 2.2 × 10<sup>4</sup> particles/mL for fluorescence detection. Notably, the colorimetric platform revealed that the relative expression of the CD63 protein on exosomes from breast cancer cells MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was approximately 2.7 and 2.4 times higher, respectively, than in normal breast cells MCF-10A; similar fold changes of 2.9 and 2.4 were observed with fluorescence detection, underscoring the robustness of the dual-mode system. The platform demonstrated rapid detection (within 30 min), high sensitivity, strong anti-interference capability, and the ability to distinguish exosomes from cancerous and normal cells effectively.\n","Journal : Talanta\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : 10.1016/j.talanta.2024.127380\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 39710273\n","Titre : CircDUSP16 mediates the effect of triple-negative breast cancer in pirarubicin via the miR-1224-3p/TFDP2 axis.\n","Résumé : Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive molecular subtype of breast cancer characterized by a high recurrence rate, poor prognosis, and elevated mortality. Identifying novel molecular targets is crucial for developing more effective therapeutic strategies against TNBC. Recent studies have highlighted the role of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in the progression of TNBC. In this study, we identified and validated that circDUSP16 (hsa_circ_0003855) is significantly upregulated in TNBC cells, tissues, and plasma exosomes. Functional assays in vitro demonstrated that overexpression of circDUSP16 promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of TNBC cells, weathers circDUSP16 knockdown exerted the opposite effect. In vivo studies confirmed that circDUSP16 knockdown can inhibit tumor growth. Using bioinformatics analysis, circDUSP16/miR-1224-3p/TFDP2 pathway was predicted and cascaded. Mechanistically, circDUSP16 was shown to promote the progression of TNBC via the miR-1224-3p/TFDP2 axis. Additionally, THP, a commonly used anthracycline chemotherapy drug, was found to downregulate circDUSP16, suggesting that its therapeutic effects on TNBC may be mediated through circDUSP16/miR-1224-3p/TFDP2 pathway. Our findings suggest that circDUSP16 is a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target for TNBC.\n","Journal : Biochemical pharmacology\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : 10.1016/j.bcp.2024.116719\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","Que voulez-vous faire ?\n","1.
