Inhalation therapy is widely used as a basic first-line treatment for such diseases. However, inappropriate selection of inhalation devices and usage methods is common, leading to poor disease control and prognosis, as well as a waste of medical resources. In order to facilitate the reasonable selection and appropriate use of inhaler devices, improve the efficacy of inhalation therapy, and increase patient compliance, the Inhalation Therapy and Respiratory Rehabilitation Group, Respiratory Equipment Committee of China Association of Medical Equipment, and Chinese Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Coalition organized experts to revise the <i>Chinese expert consensus on standardized inhaler device application in stable chronic respiratory disease patients (2019 Edition)</i> based on the latest evidence-based medical evidence and clinical diagnosis and treatment experience.Chronic airway diseases can affect the anatomical and physiological structure of the respiratory tract, which can affect the inhalation and delivery of drugs. In order to achieve the maximum effect of inhaled drugs, it is necessary for the drugs to be completely released from the device and to be deposited in the peripheral airways. Therefore, inhaler devices, patients, and medical staff can have a significant impact on the effectiveness of inhalation administration. The effectiveness of inhalation administration is influenced by several factors related to the inhaler device itself, including active or passive release, aerosol characteristics, and internal device resistance. For patients, the inhalation ability, the correct use of inhaler devices (inhalation technique), and regular and quantitative inhalation (treatment compliance) are essential to achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Medical staff can influence the efficacy and compliance of patients through proper assessment of their inhalation capacity and preferences, knowledge of different inhaler device characteristics, rational selection of inhaler devices, training in inhalation techniques, and guidance on inhaler device replacement. Standardized education can help minimize operational errors and improve patients' ability to use inhaler devices effectively. In addition, deep inspiratory volume, prolonged breath-hold time, airway clearance, and reduction of upper airway curvature and resistance can further improve the efficacy of inhaled drugs. The choice of inhalation device should be based on the patient's inspiratory flow rate, hand-lung coordination ability, device operation ability, and preference.The revised consensus version provides a clear understanding of the characteristics and operating principles of different types of inhaler devices, including pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI), dry powder inhaler (DPI), soft mist inhaler (SMI), and small-volume nebulizers (SVN). The consensus categorizes pMDI as traditional pMDI (solution type, suspension type, and co-suspension type), extra-fine pMDI, and breath-actuated pMDI; and DPI into capsule, reservoir, and blister types. The inhalation device is evaluated based on three dimensions: drug delivery, device operation, and other characteristics. The indicators to assess drug delivery characteristics include lung deposition, oropharyngeal deposition, aerosol duration, aerosol plume velocities, MMAD, fine particle fractions, and dose repeatability. The indicators used to assess the operational device characteristics include inspiratory flow rate requirements, hand-breath coordination requirements, inspiratory synchronous drive, pre-use shaking, and operational steps. Other characteristic indicators include avoidance of humidity exposure, storage environment requirements, propellant, carrying convenience, counter, cleaning, and medication type. The consensus provides a detailed introduction to the personalized selection, switching, education, and follow-up of inhaler devices.1. Establishing a Chinese consensus on the individualized selection of inhaler devices for patients based on the characteristics of different devices includes the following steps:(1) Testing the patient's hand-breath coordination using an active release inhaler device (recommended: a short-acting bronchodilator inhaler). If the device is being used for the first time or is not being used correctly, it should be re-tested after instruction.(2) Testing the patient's peak inspiratory flow rates and whether they can consistently inhale at an inspiratory flow rate of 30 L/min for 3 seconds (an alternative assessment method is to continue eating yoghurt through a straw).(3) Assessing the need for non-invasive ventilation in patients with poor hand-breath coordination.(4) Based on the evaluation results, the recommendations for different inhaler devices are as follows:① Patients with good hand-breath coordination and the ability to inhale consistently at an inspiratory flow rate of 30 L/min (or more) for more than 3 seconds can use any inhaler device; ② Patients with poor hand-breath coordination who can achieve a peak inspiratory flow rate of 30L/min can use DPI or an active release device with a Spacer; ③ Patients with good hand-breath coordination, a peak inspiratory flow rate less than 30 L/min, and a constant inspiratory flow for more than 3 seconds can use SMI or an active release device with a Spacer; ④ Patients with poor hand-breath coordination, a peak inspiratory flow rate less than 30 L/min, and a constant inspiratory flow for more than 3 seconds can use SMI and an active release device with a Spacer; ⑤ Patients with a peak inspiratory flow rate less than 30 L/min and a constant inspiratory flow for less than 3 seconds can use an active release device with a Spacer; ⑥ Patients who require non-invasive ventilation can use an active release device and nebulizers(Active release devices include pMDI and SMI).2. Switching inhaler devices:The need to switch inhaler devices should be clear, and there are indications for switching:(1) inhaled drugs has been changed or added because of the patient's condition, requiring delivery by another inhaler device.(2) the patient was unable to use the inhaler device correctly after several training attempts.(3) patients were dissatisfied with the inhaler device and had poor adherence.(4) the patient used the device correctly, but the therapeutic effect was unsatisfactory.Once the decision to switch the inhaler device has been made, the following steps should be taken:(1) explain the necessity of switching the inhaler device.(2) retrain the patient in the use of the new inhaler device.(3) intensify follow-up to obtain patient feedback on the use of the new device and to check inhalation technique, drug consumption and efficacy.3. Education on inhalation technique:It is crucial to educate patients on proper inhalation technique. Teaching patients how to use inhaler devices in a standardized way is an important measure to ensure that they use the devices correctly. This helps to improve the accuracy of inhaler device operation, patient adherence, disease control, and reduce disease burden. Relying solely on the instructions provided with the inhaler device is not sufficient to adequately educate patients, and patients' inhalation technique may unintentionally change over time, resulting in decreased efficacy. Inhalation technique should be regularly reviewed and corrected at each visit.4. Follow-up of inhalation therapy:Follow-up management is a crucial part of maximizing patient efficacy, including assessing efficacy, correcting operation techniques, and promoting adherence.5. Other:When patients with chronic airway diseases are at risk of respiratory epidemic infectious diseases, the use of inhaler devices should strictly comply with the requirements for the prevention and control of such diseases.\n","Journal : Zhonghua jie he he hu xi za zhi = Zhonghua jiehe he huxi zazhi = Chinese journal of tuberculosis and respiratory diseases\n","Date de publication : 2023\n","DOI : 10.3760/cma.j.cn112147-20230411-00167\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 37524490\n","Titre : Delivery technology of inhaled therapy for asthma and COPD.\n","Résumé : Inhaled therapy is the cornerstone of the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Drugs such as bronchodilators and corticosteroids are administered directly to the airways for local effect and rapid onset of action while systemic exposure and side effects are minimized. There are four major types of inhaler devices used clinically to generate aerosols for inhalation, namely, pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs), nebulizers, Soft Mist™ inhalers (SMIs) and dry powder inhalers (DPIs). Each of them has its own unique characteristics that can target different patient groups. For instance, patients' inhaler technique is critical for pMDIs and SMIs to achieve proper drug deposition in the lung, which could be challenging for some patients. Nebulizers are designed to deliver aerosols to patients during tidal breathing, but they require electricity to operate and are less portable than other devices. DPIs are the only device that delivers aerosols in dry powder form with better stability, but they rely on patients' inspiration effort for powder dispersion, rendering them unsuitable for patients with compromised lung function. Choosing a device that can cater for the need of individual patient is paramount for effective inhaled therapy. This chapter provides an overview of inhaled therapy for the management of asthma and COPD. The operation principles, merits and limitations of different delivery technologies are examined. Looking ahead, the challenges of delivering novel therapeutics such as biologics through the pulmonary route are also discussed.\n","Journal : Advances in pharmacology (San Diego, Calif.)\n","Date de publication : 2023\n","DOI : 10.1016/bs.apha.2023.03.001\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 37167141\n","Titre : [Assessment of inhalation technique in patients with bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease].\n","Résumé : Investigate inhalation techniques using different inhalers types and their effect on the course of disease.\n","Journal : Terapevticheskii arkhiv\n","Date de publication : 2023\n","DOI : 10.26442/00403660.2023.03.202151\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","Que voulez-vous faire ?\n","1.

The environmental impact of a product is estimated by its carbon footprint (CF). Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) have a higher CF than dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMIs) due to the incorporation of GHGs. The objectives are to analyze the consumption of inhalers (β2-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators, anticholinergics, and/or corticosteroids) in a cystic fibrosis unit and estimate the generated CF.\n","Journal : Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : S1130-6343(24)00136-3\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 39568351\n","Titre : [Sustainability and choice of inhaled treatment for obstructive pulmonary diseases].\n","Résumé : Inhaled treatments are essential for obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDI) use propellant gases, contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and thereby to climate change. The use of dry powder inhalers (DPI) or soft mist inhalers (SMI) when clinically appropriate is a way to reduce these emissions. It is essential to confirm the diagnosis, promote adherence and therapeutic education, and support effective recycling policies and the development of less polluting treatments. In any case, the right inhaler is the one that suits the patient, is used correctly, and stabilizes of the respiratory condition.\n","Journal : Revue medicale suisse\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : 10.53738/REVMED.2024.20.896.2173\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 39400958\n","Titre : Environmental impact of pressurised metered dose inhalers versus dry powder and soft mist inhalers at a tertiary Melbourne hospital.\n","Résumé : The carbon footprint of devices to deliver inhaled respiratory medications has come into focus as climate change has been identified as a worldwide emergency. Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) contain hydrofluorocarbons that have significant global warming potential compared to dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMIs), which do not use a propellant gas.

The environmental impact of a product is estimated by its carbon footprint (CF). Pressurized metered-dose inhalers (pMDIs) have a higher CF than dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMIs) due to the incorporation of GHGs. The objectives are to analyze the consumption of inhalers (β2-adrenergic agonist bronchodilators, anticholinergics, and/or corticosteroids) in a cystic fibrosis unit and estimate the generated CF.\n","Journal : Farmacia hospitalaria : organo oficial de expresion cientifica de la Sociedad Espanola de Farmacia Hospitalaria\n","Date de publication : 2024\n","DOI : S1130-6343(24)00136-3\n","------------------------------------------\n","\n","------------------------------------------\n","ID : 39568351\n","Titre : [Sustainability and choice of inhaled treatment for obstructive pulmonary diseases].\n","Résumé : Inhaled treatments are essential for obstructive lung diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The use of dry powder inhalers (DPI) or soft mist inhalers (SMI) when clinically appropriate is a way to reduce these emissions. It is essential to confirm the diagnosis, promote adherence and therapeutic education, and support effective recycling policies and the development of less polluting treatments.

Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) contain hydrofluorocarbons that have significant global warming potential compared to dry powder inhalers (DPIs) and soft mist inhalers (SMIs), which do not use a propellant gas.
